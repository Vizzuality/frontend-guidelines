# Framer motion

Framer motion is a library that makes it easy to animate elements in React. It's a great library to use for simple animations, but it can also be used for more complex animations. Check the [documentation](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for more information.

It is great for creating dynamic and interactive animations that respond to user input. However, for simple CSS animations, it can be overkill and may add unnecessary complexity to your code. In these cases, it is better to use a simpler solution like the Tailwind CSS animate plugin, which provides a set of utility classes that you can use to easily add simple animations to your elements. This allows you to keep your code simple and easy to read, while still adding some visual interest to your UI.
