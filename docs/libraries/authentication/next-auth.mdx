# NextAuth

NextAuth.js is an open-source authentication library for Next.js applications. It provides a simple and easy-to-use API for implementing various authentication strategies, including email/password, social logins, and more.

Check the [getting started](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/example) guide for more information on how to use NextAuth.js in your Next.js project.

## Environment variables
See the [documentation](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options#environment-variables) for more information.
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` environment variable to the URL of your application.
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` environment variable to a random string.

## Add token to all requests with Axios

If you are using Axios, you can add the token to all requests with an interceptor. Check the [this thread](https://next-auth.js.org/tutorials/securing-pages-and-api-routes#add-token-to-all-requests-with-axios) for more information.

```ts
AXIOS_INSTANCE.interceptors.request.use(async (request) => {
  if (lastSession === null || Date.now() > Date.parse(lastSession.expires)) {
    const session = typeof window === "undefined" ? await getServerSession(authOptions) : await getSession();
    lastSession = session;
  }

  if (lastSession) {
    const Authorization = `Bearer ${lastSession.apiToken}`;

    request.headers.Authorization = Authorization;
  } else {
    delete request.headers.Authorization;
  }

  return request;
});
```
