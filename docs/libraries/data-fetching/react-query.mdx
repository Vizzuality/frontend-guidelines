# React query

React Query is a popular library for managing server state in React applications. It provides a simple and easy-to-use API for fetching, caching, and updating data from a server.

Check out the [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) documentation for more information.

> ### Important note
> If you are insterested in prefetching some queries on the server side, you should check the [docs](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/guides/ssr#using-the-app-directory-in-nextjs-13).
>
> We strongly recommend to use the `<Hydrate>` method instead of `initialData` on the server side to prevent props drilling.
