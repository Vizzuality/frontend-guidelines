# shadcn-ui

[`shadcn-ui`](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs) is our preferred approach to implement components by copy/pasting code. This allows us to not maintain generic components on our own
and modifying them according to our needs without worrying about breaking changes.

To start using shadcn-ui, just type:

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest init
```

Like with `create-next-app`, you will be asked a few questions about your project:

```bash
Would you like to use TypeScript (recommended)? no / **yes**
Which style would you like to use? › **Default**
Which color would you like to use as base color? › **Slate**
Where is your global CSS file? › › app/globals.css
Do you want to use CSS variables for colors? › no / **yes**
Where is your tailwind.config.js located? › tailwind.config.js
Configure the import alias for components: › @/components
Configure the import alias for utils: › @/lib/utils
Are you using React Server Components? › no / **yes**
```

Again, in `**{option}**` our recommendations. For the questions asking for paths, make sure they make sense according to you folder structure.

From here, just follow `shadcn-ui` instructions to add new components to your project.

> Do not forget to lint the code generated by `shadcn-ui`, as it does not follow our linting rules and it might break your `pre-commit` hook or deployments.
