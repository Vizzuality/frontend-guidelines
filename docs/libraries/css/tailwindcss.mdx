# Styling the application: TailwindCSS

During the [setup of the project](/docs/project-setup-nextjs-getting-started--docs), you will be prompted to use [`tailwindcss`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) as CSS framework. This is our preffered choice as well.
The setup will take of eveything to have it up and ready to use, but the developer has to go to the `tailwind.config.js` file and customize
the theme according to the project needs.

The designer of your project should provide these colors along with other styles in the UI Kit hosted in Figma. Make sure those colors follow
[tailwind's naming convention](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors) so you can easily apply them to the theme.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: if you plan to use `shadcn-ui`, make sure you install it before modyfing the `tailwind.config.js` file.
Why? `shadcn-ui` will override your configuration file with its own, so you will have to re-apply your changes later again.

When using `tailwindcss` in your project, there are two tools strongly recommended that will improve your DX:

- [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)
- [Tailwind CSS prettier plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/automatic-class-sorting-with-prettier)
