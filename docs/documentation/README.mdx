# The README file

The README file is the main informative entrypoint of the project. It contains information of several natures, including:
descriptions, goals, technical information, installation/usage, licensing and more. It is important to keep it up to date
so other developers can get into the project without too much trouble.

While there are many aspects of the README that can be written for non-technical people, as developer you must ensure that the technical information to run
and understand the project is always up to date. This includes:

- Installation/running instructions,
- environment variables (information, not values),
- useful links (to other documentation, for example),
- anything else that is relevant to the project.
