# Welcome to the Vizzuality Front-end Guidelines

The goal of this document is to inform/advise of the technologies/practices used by the front-end team to develop projects at Vizzuality and how to start a project from scratch.

**The guidelines are NOT a must but a recommendation. We are always open to new technologies and practices that can improve our workflow and makes our lifes easier.**

New approaches or suggestions should be discussed with the team and agreed before being implemented.
