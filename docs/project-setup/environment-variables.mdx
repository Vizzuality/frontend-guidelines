# T3 Env

Forgetting environment variables during build can be a hassle and difficult to debug if a bug is caused by a missing environment variable. This package provides a simple way to define environment variables validation for your app.

This library does all the grunt work for you, simply define your schema and use your environment variables safely.

> ### Important note
>
> You need to rename you `next.config.js` to `next.config.mjs` for this to work
