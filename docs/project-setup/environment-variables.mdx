# Environment variables

Without getting into details (you can read more about it [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables)), we follow the NextJS approach to handle our environmental variables.
Meaning we can use valid files like `.env.development`, `.env.production` and `.env.local` to define our variables.

> It is a good practice keep your non-secret variables in a `.env.development` file and commit it, instead of creating a `.env.default` (which servers the same purpose but it is not valid, just informative).
> Your `.env.development` file will be loaded along with your `.env.local` file, keeping at minimum the environmental variables you need to run your app locally.

Also, when creating new environmental variables do not forget to **document their purpose**. You can do this in the own `.env.development` file, or in the `README.md` file.

Finally, if you are dealing with a sensitive environmental variable (like a token), do not forget to add it to the software the company is using to handle this kind of sensitive information.

## T3 Env: bringing type safety to your environment variables

Forgetting environment variables during build can be a hassle and difficult to debug if a bug is caused by a missing environment variable. This package provides a simple way to define environment variables validation for your app.

This library does all the grunt work for you, simply define your schema and use your environment variables safely.

> You need to rename you `next.config.js` to `next.config.mjs` for this to work
