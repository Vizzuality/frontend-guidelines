# The Framework: NextJS

_The goal of this guideline is to provide a quick overview of the NextJS framework and how to start working on a project from scratch with it.
To look into the details of the framework, please refer to the [official documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs)._

[NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) is a [React](https://react.dev/) framework and our preferred option for building web applications.
The NextJS team provides a quick way to start a project from scratch via [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app),
a CLI tool to scaffold a NextJS project ready to run.
