# .gitignore

By default, after running `create-next-app`, you will have a `.gitignore` file at root level. The content will cover
the use of the framework and some standard folders.

Eventually, you will be installing more dependencies that might generate files that you don't want to commit: `/storybook-static` for `storybook`,
`/playwright-report` for `playwright`, etc.

As a thumb rule, **any file/folder that is generated as a result of running a command should be ignored**.

## The Yarn case

`yarn` >= 1 will generate a `.yarn` folder at root level where it will store the cache and the state of the project, a binary, among others. I you followed
the instructions [setting the correct version of Yarn](/docs/project-setup-managing-dependencies--docs#making-sure-we-install-the-correct-package-manager-version-corepack)
you should be safe ignoring completely the `.yarn` folder.
