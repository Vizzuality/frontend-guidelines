# The Framework: NextJS

_The goal of this guideline is to provide a quick overview of the NextJS framework and how to start working on a project from scratch with it.
To look into the details of the framework, please refer to the [official documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs)._

[NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) is a [React](https://react.dev/) framework and our preferred option for building web applications.
The NextJS team provides a quick way to start a project from scratch via [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app),
a CLI tool to scaffold a NextJS project ready to run.

## Styling the application

During the setup of the project, you will be prompted to use [`tailwindcss`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) as CSS framework. This is our preffered choice as well.
The setup will take of eveything to have it up and ready to use, but the developer has to go to the `tailwind.config.js` file and customize
the theme according to the project needs.

The designer of your project should provide these colors along with other styles in the UI Kit hosted in Figma. Make sure those colors follow
[tailwind's naming convention](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors) so you can easily apply them to the theme.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: if you plan to use `shadcn-ui`, make sure you install it before modyfing the `tailwind.config.js` file.
Why? `shadcn-ui` will override your configuration file with its own, so you will have to re-apply your changes later again.

When using `tailwindcss` in your project, there are two tools strongly recommended that will improve your DX:

- [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)
- [Tailwind CSS prettier plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/automatic-class-sorting-with-prettier)
